COG4688	5.0	L	A helicase nuclease that prepares dsDNA breaks (DSB) for recombinational DNA repair. Binds to DSBs and unwinds DNA via a highly rapid and processive ATP-dependent bidirectional helicase activity. Unwinds dsDNA until it encounters a Chi (crossover hotspot instigator) sequence from the 3' direction. Cuts ssDNA a few nucleotides 3' to the Chi site. The properties and activities of the enzyme are changed at Chi. The Chi-altered holoenzyme produces a long 3'-ssDNA overhang and facilitates RecA-binding to the ssDNA for homologous DNA recombination and repair. Holoenzyme degrades any linearized DNA that is unable to undergo homologous recombination. In the holoenzyme this subunit has ssDNA-dependent ATPase and 5'-3' helicase activity. When added to pre-assembled RecBC greatly stimulates nuclease activity and augments holoenzyme processivity. Negatively regulates the RecA-loading ability of RecBCD

COG3636	5.0	K	A helicase nuclease that prepares dsDNA breaks (DSB) for recombinational DNA repair. Binds to DSBs and unwinds DNA via a highly rapid and processive ATP-dependent bidirectional helicase activity. Unwinds dsDNA until it encounters a Chi (crossover hotspot instigator) sequence from the 3' direction. Cuts ssDNA a few nucleotides 3' to the Chi site. The properties and activities of the enzyme are changed at Chi. The Chi-altered holoenzyme produces a long 3'-ssDNA overhang and facilitates RecA-binding to the ssDNA for homologous DNA recombination and repair. Holoenzyme degrades any linearized DNA that is unable to undergo homologous recombination. In the holoenzyme this subunit has ssDNA-dependent ATPase and 5'-3' helicase activity. When added to pre-assembled RecBC greatly stimulates nuclease activity and augments holoenzyme processivity. Negatively regulates the RecA-loading ability of RecBCD

COG0507	5.0	L	A helicase nuclease that prepares dsDNA breaks (DSB) for recombinational DNA repair. Binds to DSBs and unwinds DNA via a highly rapid and processive ATP-dependent bidirectional helicase activity. Unwinds dsDNA until it encounters a Chi (crossover hotspot instigator) sequence from the 3' direction. Cuts ssDNA a few nucleotides 3' to the Chi site. The properties and activities of the enzyme are changed at Chi. The Chi-altered holoenzyme produces a long 3'-ssDNA overhang and facilitates RecA-binding to the ssDNA for homologous DNA recombination and repair. Holoenzyme degrades any linearized DNA that is unable to undergo homologous recombination. In the holoenzyme this subunit has ssDNA-dependent ATPase and 5'-3' helicase activity. When added to pre-assembled RecBC greatly stimulates nuclease activity and augments holoenzyme processivity. Negatively regulates the RecA-loading ability of RecBCD

Catalyzes the ATP-dependent conversion of formylglycinamide ribonucleotide (FGAR) and glutamine to yield formylglycinamidine ribonucleotide (FGAM) and glutamate. The FGAM synthase complex is composed of three subunits. PurQ produces an ammonia molecule by converting glutamine to glutamate. PurL transfers the ammonia molecule to FGAR to form FGAM in an ATP-dependent manner. PurS interacts with PurQ and PurL and is thought to assist in the transfer of the ammonia molecule from PurQ to PurL
